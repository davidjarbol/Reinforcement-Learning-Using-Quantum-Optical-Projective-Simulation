# Reinforcement-Learning-Using-Quantum-Optical-Projective-Simulation
Quandela organized a 2-day hackathon at the University of Paris-Saclay, where my team of five solved the 2D labyrinth problem using quantum projective simulation with Percival, the
Python-based language of Quandela for building single-photon quantum circuits. We designed the optical circuit and demonstrated simulations with and without noise.
